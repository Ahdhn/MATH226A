\paragraph{Part a:} The computes each sub-interval (.i.e, $a-c$ and $c-b$) twice; one before the refinement and one after. It would have been more efficient to pass this evaluation in the recursive call rather than computing them twice. 

\paragraph{Part b:}
The following table sums the results of running \emph{quad} and \emph{adapt} function to evaluate $\int^{1}_{0}=\frac{1}{x+0.01}.dx$.

\emph{adopt} needs $18x$ more function evaluations. At each step, \emph{adopt} needs to at least performs two more (redundant) function evaluations. It is possible that with increasing number of function evaluations, a loss in precision increases and thus less accurate results are obtained and even more functions evaluations are needed. 
\paragraph{Part c:}
The error term in the composite Simpsons rule is $R_{T} = \frac{(b-a)}{180} h^{4} f^{4}(\zeta)$, $\zeta \in [a,b]$. Thus, in order to get the error below $10^{-10}$, we need
\[
R_{T} = \frac{1}{180}h^{4} \frac{24}{(\zeta+0.01)^{5}} < 10^{-10}
\]
The term $\frac{24}{(x+0.01)^{5}}$ is maximum when $\zeta=0$. For that, we get $n>60427$.

For composite Trapezoidal rule, the error term is $R_{T} = -\frac{1}{12}(b-a)h^{2}f^{\prime \prime}(\zeta)$, $\zeta \in [a,b]$. For our function, we get
\[
R_{T} = \frac{-1}{12} h^{2} \frac{2}{(\zeta + 0.01)^{3}} < 10^{-10}
\]
When $\zeta = 0$, we get $n=4 * 10^7$
\paragraph{Part b:}
We run the composite Simpson's rule code in order to get the error below $10^{-10}$. Within 1000, it was not possible to get such low value of error. The minimum we get using 1000 point is $3.257 10^{-6}$. In order to get the error below $10^{-10}$, we had to use 13512 points.
