\section*{Problem No.1} \label{sec:prob1}
For a strictly column diagonally dominant matrix $A \in  \mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ , the first step of Gaussian elimination does not require pivoting since -by definition- the entry $a_{11}$ is the largest entry in the first column. We need to prove that the resulting sub-matrix $\in  \mathbb{R}^{m-1\times m-1}$ after the first step preserves the strictly column diagonally dominant matrix structure from which we can directly prove that no row interchanges are needed. 

After the first step of Gaussian elimination, matrix $U$ becomes

\[
\left| 
\begin{array}{cc cc cc}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}  & \cdots  & \cdots  & \cdots\\
0      & \frac{-a_{21}}{a_{11}}a_{12} + a_{22} & \frac{-a_{21}}{a_{11}}a_{13} + a_{23}  & \cdots  & \cdots  & \cdots\\
0      & \frac{-a_{31}}{a_{11}}a_{12} + a_{32} & \frac{-a_{31}}{a_{11}}a_{13} + a_{33}  & \cdots  & \cdots  & \cdots\\
0      & \cdots  & \cdots   & \cdots  & \cdots  & \cdots\\
\end{array} 
\right|
\] 
In order to preserve the strictly column diagonally dominant matrix structure (at least in the first column) for the sub-matrix created by removing the first row and column from the above matrix, we need to prove the following:
\[
|a_{22} - a_{12}\frac{a_{21}}{a_{11}}| > \sum_{i=3}^{m}|a_{i2} -a_{i1}\frac{a_{12}}{a_{11}}|
\]
\begin{equation}
|a_{22}{a_{11}} - a_{12}a_{21}| > \sum_{i=3}^{m}|a_{i2}a_{11} -a_{i1}a_{12}|
\label{pro}
\end{equation}
We can use the fact that
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=3}^{m}|a_{i2}a_{11} -a_{i1}a_{12}| \leq |a_{11}|\sum_{i=3}^{m}|a_{i2}| + |a_{12}|\sum_{i=3}^{m}|a_{i1}|
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
From the  strictly column diagonally dominant matrix definition, we have $\sum_{i=3}^{m}|a_{i2}| < |a_{22}|-|a_{12}|$ and  $\sum_{i=3}^{m}|a_{i1}| < |a_{11}|-|a_{21}|$. Substitute this in Equation \ref{eq1}, we get

\[
\sum_{i=3}^{m}|a_{i2}a_{11} -a_{i1}a_{12}| <  |a_{11}|(|a_{22}|-|a_{12}|) + |a_{12}|(|a_{11}|-|a_{21}|)\\
\]
\[
\sum_{i=3}^{m}|a_{i2}a_{11} -a_{i1}a_{12}| <     |a_{11}||a_{22}| - |a_{12}||a_{21}|\\
\]
\[
\sum_{i=3}^{m}|a_{i2}a_{11} -a_{i1}a_{12}| \leq  |a_{11} a_{22} - a_{12} a_{21}|
\]
which is what we want to prove in Equation \ref{pro}.
